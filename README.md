## Spec

* We also have some [ideas on the discord](https://discord.com/channels/1009193568256135208/1011201396659474432).
* Connectors / switches from wuerth
* USB C PSU, 3.3v and 1.8v
* Adjustable clock / single step
* 9 DIP switch for design select (or jumpers)
* 8 DIP switch for inputs - should last for some fiddling but donâ€™t need to be too heavy duty - could be buttons.
* 8 LEDs for outputs: 7 segment display inc dot
* Include PMOD headers for IOs, but better if single inline for breadboarding
    * Pluggable into breadboard 
* Flash for firmware used to setup GPIO
* Want to ship everything done - no soldering.
* Done in Kicad for easy contributions
